## Summary

Removed overly promotional/salesy language throughout the website. Replaced with direct, confident messaging that reflects an established relationship with IMMPL leadership.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hero Section (`src/components/Hero.tsx`)

**OLD (Salesy):**
```
Transform AI from Essentials to Production-Ready Tools
Move from basic understanding to applied learning and AI-in-production across IMMPL's teams. Build internal tools, automate workflows, and unlock organizational AI maturity.
```

**NEW (Direct):**
```
3-Month Engagement: Training + Tool Development + Delivery
Training + adoption + custom AI tools built and shipped monthly. Clear deliverables across all three areas.
```

### 2. Program Overview (`src/components/ProgramOverview.tsx`)

**OLD (Transformational language):**
```
A comprehensive 3-month program combining training, adoption, and custom AI tool development. Move IMMPL from AI essentials to production-ready systems with a dedicated fractional CTO team.
```

**NEW (Straightforward):**
```
Three parallel streams: hands-on training, workflow enablement, and custom tool development. Clear monthly outputs across all areas.
```

### 3. Pricing Section - Main Offer (`src/pages/Pricing.tsx`)

**OLD (Salesy):**
```
Fractional CTO + AI Build
Everything you need to transform from AI essentials to production-ready tools
```

**NEW (Direct):**
```
3-Month Engagement
One monthly fee covers training, adoption, and custom tool development. Clear deliverables each month.
```

### 4. Pricing Section - CTA (`src/pages/Pricing.tsx`)

## Tone Changes

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Overall Tone** | Promotional/Transformational | Direct/Confident |

| **CTA Language** | "Get Started" | "Let's Talk" |
| **Language Style** | Marketing speak | Business to business |

✅ **Professional**: Direct, confident tone appropriate for established relationships  
✅ **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what gets delivered, not abstract benefits

## Messaging Philosophy Going Forward

For future updates, maintain this approach:

1. **Lead with deliverables** ("We'll build X, Y, Z")
2. **Use clear, concrete language** (not "transform", just state what happens)
3. **Assume competence** (no need to over-explain value)
4. **Professional tone** (business-like, not marketing-like)
5. **Focus on execution** (how it gets done, not dreams of what could be)

## Next Review Points

When reviewing the website, focus on these areas for any remaining sales language:

- Wave 1-3 page introductions
- FAQ "Why Futurelab Studios" section
- Any call-to-action buttons or links
- Team page descriptions

Current state: **Direct and professional** ✅
